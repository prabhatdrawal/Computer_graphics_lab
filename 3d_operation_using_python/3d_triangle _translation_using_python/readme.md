### ðŸ“˜ **Theory of 3D Scaling Transformation in Computer Graphics**

### âœ… **Introduction**

In **computer graphics**, **3D scaling** is a basic geometric transformation used to change the **size** of a 3D object. It can increase (enlarge) or decrease (shrink) the dimensions of the object along the **X, Y, and Z axes**. This transformation is applied by multiplying the coordinates of the object by **scaling factors**.

### âœ… **Mathematical Representation**

If a point $P(x, y, z)$ is scaled, the new coordinates $P'(x', y', z')$ after scaling are:

$$
x' = S_x \cdot x \\
y' = S_y \cdot y \\
z' = S_z \cdot z
$$

Where:

* $S_x$, $S_y$, and $S_z$ are the scaling factors along the X, Y, and Z axes.
* If a scaling factor > 1 â†’ object enlarges.
* If 0 < scaling factor < 1 â†’ object shrinks.
* If scaling factor = 1 â†’ no change.
* If negative â†’ object is flipped along the respective axis.

### âœ… **Homogeneous Coordinates and Scaling Matrix**

In computer graphics, transformations are usually performed using **matrix multiplication** in **homogeneous coordinates**. A 3D point is written as a 4Ã—1 matrix:

$$
P = \begin{bmatrix}
x \\
y \\
z \\
1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

The **3D scaling matrix** is a 4Ã—4 matrix:

$$
S = \begin{bmatrix}
S_x & 0   & 0   & 0 \\
0   & S_y & 0   & 0 \\
0   & 0   & S_z & 0 \\
0   & 0   & 0   & 1
\end{bmatrix}
$$

To get the scaled point $P'$:

$$
P' = S \cdot P
$$

### âœ… **Types of 3D Scaling**

1. **Uniform Scaling**:

   * $S_x = S_y = S_z$
   * The object scales equally in all directions.
   * Shape is preserved.

2. **Non-Uniform (Differential) Scaling**:

   * $S_x \ne S_y \ne S_z$
   * The object is stretched or compressed differently along each axis.
   * May distort the shape.

### âœ… **Scaling with Respect to a Fixed Point**

By default, scaling is done with respect to the **origin** $(0, 0, 0)$.
To scale with respect to any **fixed point** $(x_f, y_f, z_f)$, follow these steps:

1. Translate the object so that the fixed point moves to the origin.
2. Apply the scaling.
3. Translate the object back to its original position.

This is done using a combination of translation and scaling matrices:

$$
P' = T^{-1} \cdot S \cdot T \cdot P
$$

### âœ… **Applications of 3D Scaling**

* Resizing 3D models in animation or CAD.
* Zooming in/out in virtual environments.
* Reshaping objects in simulations or games.
* Adjusting proportions of 3D elements in scenes.

### âœ… **Conclusion**

**3D scaling** is a vital transformation in computer graphics that allows objects to be resized in 3D space. Using matrix operations and homogeneous coordinates makes this transformation efficient and consistent in rendering pipelines. It plays a key role in object modeling, animation, and visualization.
