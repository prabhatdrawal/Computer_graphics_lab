### Theory of Reflection of a Triangle about the x-axis

**Reflection** in geometry refers to the flipping of a figure over a specific line (called the **line of reflection**) to produce a mirror image. When we reflect a **triangle about the x-axis**, each point of the triangle is mirrored across the x-axis.

### 1. **Mathematical Rule**

If a point on the triangle has coordinates $(x, y)$, then its **reflected point across the x-axis** will be:

$$
(x, y) \rightarrow (x, -y)
$$

This means:

* The **x-coordinate** stays the same.
* The **y-coordinate** becomes its **negative** (mirrored vertically).

### 2. **Steps to Reflect a Triangle about the x-axis**

Suppose you have a triangle with vertices:

* $A(x_1, y_1)$
* $B(x_2, y_2)$
* $C(x_3, y_3)$

Then the reflected triangle $A'B'C'$ will have vertices:

* $A'(x_1, -y_1)$
* $B'(x_2, -y_2)$
* $C'(x_3, -y_3)$

### 3. **Graphical Understanding**

Imagine flipping the triangle over the x-axis like turning a page downward:

* Points above the x-axis move to the same distance below it.
* Points already on the x-axis stay unchanged.

---

### 4. **Properties of Reflection**

* Shape and size remain unchanged.
* Angles and side lengths stay the same.
* Orientation (clockwise â†” counterclockwise) **reverses**.
* It is a type of **rigid transformation**.

### 5. **Applications**

* Computer graphics and animation
* Geometry problems and proofs
* Robotics (path planning)
* Symmetry detection
